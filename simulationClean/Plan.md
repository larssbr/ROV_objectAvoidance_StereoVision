# Restructure the code so you can run it in a for loop

UNDER PROGRESS

Make it object oriented --- its easier to have the variabels in this way --- and needs to be done



# Run all the same images as under the real experiment
- DONE


# send "udp" message of simulated direction
-DONE

--> Save the sent udp messages in a file

# plot trajectory of ROV, in the same time the images are taken
    --> Need (x,y,z) postion
    --> position of transponder tower
    
    
       
# Create movie of simulation

# Compare the metod with the superpixel - method


# read in files in the correct order

tokt1_L_268.jpg

so when reading the filename, we will start reading the number from  before .jpg (4 letters)
Then we will read untill we meet __ 
That is then the correct number


# command to read out the timsestampn of the creation of files  and place them in output.txt
 
forfiles /c "cmd /c echo @file @ftime" > output.txt
